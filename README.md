## About Claude Code

Claude Code is an agentic coding tool that lives in your terminal, understands your codebase, and helps you code faster by executing routine tasks, explaining complex code, and handling git workflows - all through natural language commands.

Some of its key capabilities include:

- Edit files and fix bugs across your codebase
- Answer questions about your code's architecture and logic
- Execute and fix tests, lint, and other commands
- Search through git history, resolve merge conflicts, and create commits and PRs
